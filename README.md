[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-assessment-images-manager-iam/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-assessment-images-manager-iam/actions)

This is a generic skeleton project that can be used to quickly get a
new [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov) [Terraform
module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) GitHub
repository started.  This skeleton project contains [licensing
information](LICENSE), as well as [pre-commit
hooks](https://pre-commit.com) and
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configurations
appropriate for the major languages that we use.

See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) for more
details on Terraform modules and the standard module structure.

## Usage ##

1. Create a Terraform workspace (if you haven't already done so) by running
   `terraform workspace new <workspace_name>`
1. Create a `<workspace_name>.tfvars` file with all of the required
  variables (see [Inputs](#Inputs) below for details):

  ```hcl
  ```

1. Run the command `terraform init`.
1. Run the command `terraform apply
  -var-file=<workspace_name>.tfvars`.
